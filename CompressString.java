/**
 * Problem statement:
 * Given a string, replace adjacent, repeated characters with the character followed by the number of repeated occurrences. 
 * If the character does not has any adjacent, repeated occurrences, it is not changed.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 * 1. the input string is not null 
 * 2. characters of the input string are within set of [a-z]
 * 3. There are no adjacent repeated characters with length > 9
 *
 * Example:
 * "abbcccdeee" â†’ "ab2c3de3"
